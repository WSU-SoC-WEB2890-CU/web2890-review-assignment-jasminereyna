TODO: List here all the changes you made to given template to adapt it to your needs

Change 1: Logo Change - I wanted a logo that represented me better, so I found one that represents me well and whose color 
scheme fits the website.

Change 2: Hover Color for footer links - Since most of the text and icons in the footer are white, I needed to make the Hover
color still noticable so I made it the lighter blue color.

Change 3: Gradient effect on the Work Experience section - rather than keeping the background one solid color, I decided to use
the gradient mixin for the background color as well to keep the theme consistent

Change 4: Hover color for buttons -  I wanted to keep all the colors around the same 3 different shades, so I made the hover color
for the buttons the lighter shade of blue.

Change 5: Font for headers - I wanted the font of the headers to not look too plain, so I changed it to a font called "Montserrat".

Change 6: Paragraph Font - For the paragraphs, I changed the font to "Bitter" because I felt like it complemented the "Montserrat"
font that I used for the headers.

Change 7: Rounded button background color - I made the background color of the buttons a lighter shade of the purple so that it
doesn't look too bright.
